# Group-One-Project-3

Creating a MERN Stack Single-Page Application!

## Introduction

For this assignment, our team attempted to build a collectible shopping application in the form of a scalable, user-focused MERN app.

When entering the app, the user will have the option to signup or login.

Once signed in, the user will choose whether they are a buyer or a seller.

If they are a buyer, they will be directed to a page where they view collectibles/items one at a time, and message the seller if they like an item, or view another item randomly if they click the x on the BuyingCard.

If they are a seller, they can enter the name and description of an item they are interested in selling, which will then be added to the items that can be randomly viewed by the buyer.

The users (if they are buyers) also have the option to post reviews of the seller on the application.

## Criteria
To meet the Accepted Criteria of this assignment, our team attempted to meet the following:

* Using React for the client folder front-end.

* Using GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server for the server folder back-end.

* Using MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

* Use queries and mutations (CRUD Operations) for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

* Deploying our application using Render (with data).

* Displaying a polished User Interface using CSS.

* Be responsive.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Include JWT authentication.

* Using bcrypt to protect sensitive information on the server.

* Having a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, etc...).

* Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## References

To complete this assignment our team studied the following activities from the Class Modules 18-NoSQL as references:

"11-Ins_MERN-Setup"

"19-Ins_MERN-Review"

"21-Ins_Sign-JWT"

"23-Ins_Decode-JWT"

"26-Stu_Resolver-Context"

The process of coding for me involved using code from the activities mentioned above and commenting out every section of code in all of the files to see what each specific block of code accomplished as we were structuring the app in the server-client manner as shown in modules 20 (REACT) and 21 (MERN)

The structuring process involved creating the folders/files in the following order:

Back-End (server):

config

server.js

models

schemas

seeders

utils (auth)

Front-End (client):

assets

vite.config

index.html

utils (mutations and queries)

pages (React styled with CSS)

components (React styled with CSS)

This led to a lot of experimentation in order to see what our team felt was needed to ultimately complete as much of the Accepted Criteria as possible.  To see if the back end was running properly, we used the GraphQL app to test the queries and mutations.
